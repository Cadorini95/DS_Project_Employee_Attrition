# DS_Project_Employee_Attrition

 This repository contains a data science project related to the analysis of a public dataset involving information about employees.

There are two files available in this repository: one is developed in RStudio and the other one in Jupyter notebook (format.ipynb). Both files contain Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), dataset treatments, feature and model selection. However, the files have different structures and details.

The main goal is to keep improving the overall results, feature engineering and model selection in the next deploy versions.
